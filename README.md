# Blockchain all the things!
This repo documents the thought process & ideas, mainly during the HackFS hackathon.

So far the list of ideas we have been thinking about are;

* Governance, particularly around voting schemes.
  * Doesn't really relate to the hackathon concept, as this is a storage solution hackathon first and foremost.
* Building a sort of an npm, utilising IPFS.
  * Code being public and/or easily accessible by others?
* Leveraging the npm on IPFS type of solution to build a CI/CD on IPFS - akin to TravisCI from web2 world.
  * Non-compliance regarding "what-if someone reads our code (again)".
* Pay-as-you-go video streaming
  * Perhaps some form of adult service? Credit card systems shy away from allowing sex-workers to provide content & get paid for it; perhaps this can solve it.
  * How do we make sure the data here is _erasable_?
