Step 1. Go to your profile and mint a profile NFT. This is a collection for NFTs and is a contract we mint.
We need;

- Connection to a chain
  - Which chain? - Polygon for minting. Payment probably on Aztec.
- Wallet connection (MetaMask)
- WAGMI library - web3 lib for react can be used here.
- Rainbow SDK can be used. (https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbowkit)
- HardHat https://hardhat.org/docs
- POC on Aztec

When you login you sign a unique message that is your private / public key pair.
Once you sign we derive a private key.
